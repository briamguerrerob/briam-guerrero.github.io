I am a MRes in Economics (APE) student in the Paris School of Economics and Sorbonne School of Economics. My fields of interests are Applied Econometrics, Applied Microeconomics and Development. 

I hold a MSc in Applied Mathematics & a BSc in Economics (2019) from Santo Domingo Institute of Technology (2023). Previously I worked as an Economist in the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, as a Research Coordinator in GPCN and as a Research and Development Specialist in EDUCA.
